# Toronto Transit Time

A [Pebble](https://www.pebble.com/) application that shows bus/streetcar arrival time predictions for nearby stops in Toronto.

It supports all Pebble models - including [Pebble Time Round](https://www.pebble.com/pebble-time-round-smartwatch-features):

### Download

[Click here](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/57315941c351ffcdf500000f) if you are on your mobile phone to install the watchapp (or just to get more info).

Alternatively, you can search for "Toronto Transit App" on the Pebble Time app.

In any case, there is no need to install any companion app, or preload/configure anything. Just install and run.


### Structure

The `/app` directory contains:

- The C code of the main application that runs on Pebble (with separate files for the routes and predictions windows and layers, plus a splash screen layer that is shared among them).
- The JavaScript code that runs on the phone and provides location and internet API request/parsing services to the C app.

The `/server` directory contains a Rails app that:
- Pre-fetches the stops from the TTC system.
- Exposes an endpoint that receives a pair of coordinates and returns the closest stops and the routes served by each of those stops.

That back-end is used only to get the routes/stops list. Predictions and service messages are gathered directly from the TTC back-end.
