TODO

- Create statusbar layer
- Ensure both windows add it (and never run over it, by pushing either top layer frame or bounds)

- Set proper load/unload handlers in windows (see https://developer.pebble.com/guides/best-practices/modular-app-architecture/)

- Make EPOCH_TIME messages numeric
- Store all info from prediction messages in arrays
- Ensure prediction is not leaking memory (it will be called multiple times)
- Build scrollable textlayer with predictions
- Devise a way to refresh the times

- Upon proper events ("Finding you...", "Finding stops around you...", "Error", call info_message)
