TODO

- Create statusbar layer
- Ensure both windows add it (and never run over it, by pushing either top layer frame or bounds)

- Separate layers/windows in their own dirs/files (see notes)

- Make EPOCH_TIME messages numeric
- Store all info from prediction messages in arrays
- Ensure prediction is not leaking memory (it will be called multiple time)
- Display prediction info in successive layers
  - Display times on a single layer, e.g.: 5m30s / 10m / 15m (possibly max 3?)
- Devise a way to refresh the times

- Create info layer (bitmap on top, message on bottom, all centered)
  - Create function that sets the text and moves the info layer to the top of the current window
    - Upon both windows' init, call function above with "Loading..."
    - Upon proper events ("Finding you...", "Finding stops around you...", "Error", call function above)
  - Create function that dismisses the info layer
    - Upon "ready" state for windows, call function above
