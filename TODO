TODO

(this is my internal tasks control; we're ready to publish when there is nothing else here)

- BUG: space on right side of predictions is increasing!
- BUG: messages persist upon selection change (fix: on predictions window showing (or hiding), erase old predictions/times/messages)
- auto-refresh (web) every x seconds
- exit predictions screen after y seconds (avoid battery drain)
- Increase font? / Have separate fields for predictions/alerts? / Use direction names from main menu?
- Auto-adjust scroll window height (this may be tricky) https://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/9661/dynamically-set-text-layer-height

- Rename the app: https://developer.pebble.com/legal/pebble-trademark/

- Set proper load/unload handlers in windows (see https://developer.pebble.com/guides/best-practices/modular-app-architecture/)
- Avoid crash when you enter/exit too fast (is it still happening? on real hardware?)

- Upon proper events ("Finding you...", "Finding stops around you...", "Error", call info_message)

- Improve menu listing on Chalk (see the reduction of width on top/bottom can be done; consider not showing the current time; see contentindicator https://developer.pebble.com/guides/design-and-interaction/in-the-round/)
- Consider custom fonts
- Consider custom colors: https://developer.pebble.com/guides/tools-and-resources/color-picker/#FFFFFF

- Improve back-end radius (make a smaller initial search, then double until a stop is found, until a limit)

- Show error when no stops are found

- Mention on docs:
  - http://www.watchface-generator.de/converter/
  - Slack
  - presentation on geo

- Fixture for tests (if I ever do them):
